## General Learnings

- Setting up a project directory structure effectively helps keep files organized and manageable.
- Using a local server (`python -m http.server`, or VS Code's Live Server) is essential for proper testing, especially for components like footers loaded via JavaScript.
- Learned to use live server extension for components that are hidden on default browswer, allowing tracking of workflow locally.
  - THIS WAS SO HELPFUL EVEN FOR TRACKING NORMAL WORK I DONT NEED TO REFRESH EVERYTIME
- Will integrate payment gateway API for donation in the future for secure payments.

## HTML and CSS

### CSS Organization

- Learned the importance of splitting CSS files into smaller, logical sections (`header.css`, `footer.css`, etc.) to maintain modularity.
- Used `.btn` class for default button styles and added specific classes for variations to avoid redundancy.
- Learned to style the same line of text with differnt styling by wrapping the individuals texts with span.
- Encountered a classic css override issue where the names in a file coexist with another one causing conflict

### Footer Integration

- Integrated the footer using the `fetch` API to keep code reusable across multiple pages. This improves maintainability.

## JavaScript

- Learned how javascript is used to create dynamic elements on the webpage including animations, scrolls etc..

### Dynamic Content Loading

- Used the `fetch` API to dynamically load footer content, which improved reusability across the website.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Image Overflow Issue

- Faced a horizontal overflow issue after modifying the header image. Resolved it by adjusting padding and removing elements that exceeded the container width.

### Carousel Layout Issue

- The carousel section wasnâ€™t displaying correctly when sliding across. Fixed it by ensuring elements were sized consistently and added better margin and padding for readability.

## Best Practices

- Modularize CSS to keep each section manageable.
- Use semantic HTML tags (e.g., `<section>`, `<footer>`, `<header>`) for better structure and accessibility.
- Keep reusable components like headers and footers in separate files to make maintenance easier.

## Future Improvements

- **Enhance Responsiveness**: Some sections still need better responsiveness for small screen sizes.
- **Use SCSS**: Consider using a CSS pre-processor like SCSS to manage styles more efficiently.
- **Accessibility Enhancements**: Add ARIA labels and roles to improve accessibility.

## Cloud Learnings

- Understanding the different databases AWS Offers and picking the best one for this project case
- Learnt how to deploy the package locally to lambda as editing in lambda's editor did not work
- best practise without AWS CLI is to do everything locally deploy it and test it

## Final Thoughts

Documenting learnings helps reinforce knowledge and provides a reference for similar future projects.
